@conference{BT2005,
	Abstract = {In many theorem proving applications, a proper treatment of
  equational theories or equality is mandatory.  In this paper we show
  how to integrate a modern treatment of equality in the Model
  Evolution calculus (ME), a first-order version of the propositional
  DPLL procedure.  The new calculus, MEE, is a proper extension of
  the ME calculus without equality. Like ME it maintains an explicit
  ``candidate model'', which is searched for by DPLL-style splitting.
  For equational reasoning MEE uses an adapted version of the ordered
  paramodulation inference rule, where equations used for
  paramodulation are drawn (only) from the candidate model. The
  calculus also features a generic, semantically justified
  simplification rule which covers many simplification techniques
  known from superposition-style theorem proving.  
  Our main result is the correctness of the MEE calculus in the
  presence of very general redundancy elimination criteria.},

@mastersthesis{Fuchs:Darwin:Thesis:2004,
	Abstract = {The scope of this thesis is the theorem prover Darwin,
                 the first implementation of the Model Evolution calculus,
                 a lifting of the DPLL procedure to first-order logic
                 developed by Baumgartner and Tinelli.
                 Darwin provides an initial evaluation of the calculus' potential
                 and a clean basis for further improvement.

                 After the calculus is sketched
                 the proof procedure and the chosen data structures and algorithms are presented,
                 and it is proven that these constitute
                 a proper instantiation of the calculus preserving soundness and completeness.
                 Darwin is evaluated against the TPTP Problem Library
                 and the CASC competition,
                 thereby demonstrating that for the Bernays-Sch\"{o}nfinkel class
                 Darwin's performance is on par with that of the best provers.
                 Finally, promising ideas on how to improve on the current implementation are pointed out.},

	Abstract = {Recent years have seen the development of powerful tools for verifying hardware and software systems, as companies worldwide realise the need for improved means of validating their products. There is increasing demand for training in basic methods in formal reasoning so that students can gain proficiency in logic-based verification methods. The second edition of this successful textbook addresses both those requirements, by continuing to provide a clear introduction to formal reasoning which is both relevant to the needs of modern computer science and rigorous enough for practical application. Improvements to the first edition have been made throughout, with extra and expanded sections on SAT solvers, existential/universal second-order logic, micro-models, programming by contract and total correctness. The coverage of model-checking has been substantially updated. Further exercises have been added. Internet support for the book includes worked solutions for all exercises for teachers, and model solutions to some exercises for students.},
